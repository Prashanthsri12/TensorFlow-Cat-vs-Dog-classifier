# TensorFlow-Cat-vs-Dog-classifier

This repository contains my works from Coursera's Tensorflow in Practice Specialization taught by the instructor Laurence Moroney offered by deeplearning.ai.

# About the Specialization

In this specialization, you’ll explore exciting opportunities for AI applications. Begin by developing an understanding of how to build and train neural networks. Improve a network’s performance using convolutions as you train it to identify real-world images. You’ll teach machines to understand, analyze, and respond to human speech with natural language processing systems. Learn to process text, represent sentences as vectors, and input data to a neural network. You’ll even train an AI to create original poetry!
